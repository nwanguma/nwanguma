## About:
Sometime in 2018 after a typical day of writing reports and sending vague threats via email to colleagues at my old job, I thought "hmmm this is beyond boring" then decided switching careers to tech/software development was the cure. I quit at the end of the year and spent 2019 learning to code.

Okay, now ask me how that worked out?

Pretty great! I'm a fullstack dev with verifiable experience building web applications mainly with React, Redux and everything else in between. I can center divs and style my apps with a variety of methods - I'm currently in love with CSS-in-JS (styled-components). I also have experience building RESTAPIs with Node JS, Express JS and MongoDB. I have worked with Vue JS, built my current portfolio with Gatsby JS, deployed apps with netlify and Heroku.

## Work:
I work as a front-end team lead at an agency banking startup based in Lagos, Nigeria. I built v1 and v2 of the startup's flagship agent web application which serves thousands of agents and has processed millions worth of transactions.

I am actively interviewing for remote front-end or fullstack roles though so shoot me a line if you like what you see.

## Currently working on:
Challenge ng - I'm trying to help new developers land jobs by completing challenges created by Nigerian start-ups. This app incorporates a couple other things like verified junior friendly job postings, product spotlight etc.

This is a MERN stack app with the backend completed and deployed via heroku. Building for the web with React/Redux and Styled-Components & for mobile (Android) with React Native.

## Learning:
I love to learn and I'm pretty good at it. I like to build even more complex projects than the ones included in my courses, this helps me nail down my skills. I'm currently taking a microservices with node js course on Udemy, I hope to come out of this course with pretty decent microservices architecture skills.

## Writing:
I write about my experience going from code noobie to landing my first tech role and a bunch of other stuff [here](https://nwanguma.medium.com/)

## Interests:
JavaScript, web development, music, sports.

## Say hello:
Always open for a conversation, email me at nwangumat@hotmail.com

## Random fact:
I love to share music, my favourit(est) song of all time is bittersweet symphony by the verve.
